# Web Static, What?

This project aims to bring your AirBnB objects to life by developing a front-end for your command interpreter. Instead of diving into a complex web application right away, we'll take it step by step, starting with the design and prototyping phase.

## Project Overview

The initial phase involves creating simple HTML static pages with a focus on:

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - Design and prototype each element of the web interface.
   - Create simple HTML static pages as the foundation for your application.

2. **Style Guide:**
   - Develop a style guide to establish consistent design principles.
   - Define the visual aesthetics, color schemes, fonts, and overall styling.

3. **Fake Contents:**
   - Populate your static pages with fake contents.
   - Use placeholder data to simulate the eventual dynamic content.

4. **No Javascript:**
   - Initially, we'll avoid implementing any JavaScript functionality.
   - Concentrate on the static structure and style without dynamic behavior.

5. **No Data Loaded:**
   - For this phase, refrain from loading real data from any external sources.
   - Focus on creating a static representation of the interface.

## Learning Objectives

Throughout this project, you will gain hands-on experience in:

- **HTML Manipulation:**
  - Understanding and implementing the structure of HTML pages.

- **CSS Styling:**
  - Applying styles to enhance the visual appeal of your web pages.

- **Design Principles:**
  - Developing a keen eye for design by establishing a style guide.

- **Prototyping:**
  - Creating a preliminary version of your web interface to visualize the end product.

## Guidelines

1. **Sequential Approach:**
   - Prioritize the development of HTML structure before delving into styling.
   - Ensure a solid foundation in HTML to facilitate effective styling.

2. **Style Consistency:**
   - Adhere to the style guide consistently across all pages.
   - Maintain a uniform design throughout the web interface.

3. **Placeholder Data:**
   - Utilize fake contents to simulate the presence of dynamic data.
   - This helps in visualizing the final appearance of your application.

4. **JavaScript Postponed:**
   - Reserve JavaScript implementation for future phases.
   - Concentrate on static elements and styling at this stage.

5. **Iterative Development:**
   - Embrace an iterative development approach.
   - Refine and enhance your HTML and CSS based on feedback and evolving requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Begin by creating HTML files for each page of your web interface.
2. Establish a style guide outlining design principles and aesthetics.
3. Populate the HTML files with fake contents for a realistic representation.
4. Ensure a seamless transition to the next phase by solidifying the static foundation.

Remember, a well-structured and visually appealing front-end sets the stage for a successful and user-friendly web application. Dive in, experiment, and let the creativity flow!
